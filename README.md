youtube chrome extension
This is a chrome extension to download youtube songs as mp3's, made by Jason Lum and Jason Seibel.
To use, save the files in the repository into a folder, but remember the name and location. Then go to chrome settings, 
more tools, extensions, and check the box to turn on developer mode. Then load unpacked extension and select the folder where you saved 
the files.

To use: go to a youtube url, and click the JJ button that appears on the top right and it should automatically download it to 
your downloads folder or wherever you set downloads to be saved.
